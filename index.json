For the purpose of this post we circumvent the discontinuities in the dynamics by modelling the system as hybrid. We assume a pre-defined mode schedule, so as to not deal with the combinatorial complexity of footstep planning online and use an optimal control framework for switched systems [1].\nEven if we have actuators at all internal joints, the pose of the floating base is not directly actuated so floating base systems such as legged robots are always underactuated (unless bolted to the ground). Beyond the fact it‚Äôs necessary to consider the dynamics in designing control systems for underactuated systems [2], we can further exploit the structure of the dynamics to design more efficient control architectures.\nThe whole-body dynamics of a legged robot with n actuated DoF can be represented using the Lagrangian equations of motion: $$\\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{M} (\\boldsymbol{q}) \\ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}} + \\boldsymbol{b} (\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{v}) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{0}_{6 \\times n} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{{I}}_{n \\times n} \\end{bmatrix} ^ T \\ \\boldsymbol{\\tau} + \\boldsymbol{J}_{c}^T (\\boldsymbol{q}) \\ \\boldsymbol{F}_c \\\\ \\label{lagrangian} \\end{aligned}$$ where $\\boldsymbol{q}$ is the vector of generalized coordinates, $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is the vector of generalized velocities, $\\boldsymbol{M} (\\boldsymbol{q})$ is the configuration-dependent mass-matrix, $\\boldsymbol{b} (\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{v})$ is the vector containing all non-linear and gravity effects, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is the vector of joint torques, $\\boldsymbol{J}_{c}$ is the geometric Jacobian for the end effectors, and $\\boldsymbol{F}_c$ is the stacked vector of forces at each end effector. It\u0026#39;s obvious from the selection matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{0}_{6 \\times n} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{{I}}_{n \\times n} \\end{bmatrix}$ that the dynamics are underactuated. Specifically, the dynamics can be split into an unactuated $$\\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{M}_u (\\boldsymbol{q}) \\ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}} + \\boldsymbol{b}_u (\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{v}) = \\boldsymbol{J}_{c_u}^T (\\boldsymbol{q}) \\ \\boldsymbol{F}_c \\end{aligned} \\label{unactuated}$$ and an actuated part $$\\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{M}_a (\\boldsymbol{q}) \\ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{v}} + \\boldsymbol{b}_a (\\boldsymbol{q}, \\boldsymbol{v}) = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_a + \\boldsymbol{J}_{c_a}^T (\\boldsymbol{q}) \\ \\boldsymbol{F}_c \\end{aligned} \\label{actuated}$$ Under the assumption of sufficient control authority, this split enables us to independently consider the unactuated dynamics (or centroidal dynamics). Considering a simpler model that captures the main dynamics of the system offers a significant advantage in computational complexity. Overall we will be solving two smaller optimization problems that is computationally more tractable than solving a single large optimization: an optimization of the a simpler that captures the main dynamics of the system and an optimization of the full-kinematics that must track the centroidal plan as well as fulfill whole-body tasks. In other words, by exploiting the structure of the dynamics of the floating-base system we can decompose the optimization into smaller tractable problems (a centroidal OCP and a full-kinematics OCP) that interact through a compact reference that captures the main effects of the dynamics (centroidal quantities). The centroidal plan generated from the CD OCP and the (projected) solution of the FK OCP is used as tracking reference in the FK OCP and CD OCP respectively. The CD OCP and the FK OCP must be solved in a loop (\\\u0026#34;kino-dynamic iteration\\\u0026#34;) until consensus is reached with regards to the centroidal quantities. It\u0026#39;s important to note that the CD state has a dimension of 9, while the CD input can be represented with a dimension of 6 (a wrench applied at the CoM). To address this redundancy and have a well-posed optimization that reaches consensus with the FK OCP it\u0026#39;s necessary to regularize the angular momentum [3]. The disadvantages of this method is approximately twice more parameters to tune, and solve times are dependent on how many kino-dynamic iterations were needed to reach consensus. In addition, special attention must be paid in the implementation. A real-time iteration scheme with each optimization running independently is hard to configure as communication delays can easily lead to divergence (the CD OCP can run at 100 Hz while the FK OCP at 40 Hz). ### Centroidal Dynamics (CD) OCP In the CD OCP, we consider the unactuated part through the Newton-Euler equations of the center of mass (CoM): $$\\begin{aligned} \\boldsymbol{\\dot{h}}_{com} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\boldsymbol{\\dot{p}} \\\\ m \\ \\boldsymbol{\\dot{l}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{ \\ \\boldsymbol{f}_t^{i} \\ + m \\ \\boldsymbol{g}} \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{ \\ (\\boldsymbol{r}_{com \\ c_i}^t \\times \\boldsymbol{f}_t^i)} \\end{bmatrix} \\end{aligned} \\label{systemmodelling}$$ The state in ‚Ä¶","date":1668211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668297600,"objectID":"ca34860cd62f24796bd9c856f07e335e","permalink":"https://scharalambous3.github.io/post/cdfk/","publishdate":"2022-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cdfk/","section":"post","summary":"Jointly optimizing over all decision variables with a single optimization is desirable and necessary to obtain a solution that is (locally) optimal but often not tractable at control rates (\u003e 10 Hz).
