The high-level planner is trained using RL to provide task-space references to a low-level MPC. We are thus able to leverage the benefits of both learning- and optimization-based methods including safety guarantees, great generalization, minimum sim2real gap and data-efficient training.\nDuring a pre-training stage, we use a simplified kinematic model for fast simulation. When training with MPC, we use the MPC solution as our simulator to avoid the additional cost of physics simulation. During deployment, the RL is deployed in closed-loop with the MPC.\nDeploying MPC with the planner trained using RL (Right) alleviates the issue of getting stuck in a local minimum when deploying MPC alone (Left) due to its shortsightedness.\nResults We are currently working to apply our framework in whole-body navigation to target end-effector positions in cluttered scenes in the real-world.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5ed14ca390d23609ed21cef26c9b0587","permalink":"https://scharalambous3.github.io/project/hrlmpc/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hrlmpc/","section":"project","summary":"A scalable and data-efficient framework for safety- and precision-critical loco-manipulation.","tags":null,"title":"Combining RL and MPC for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation Tasks","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Framework We present a continuation method for contact-implicit trajectory optimization that works with minimal guidance i.e. without a handcrafted initialization nor references. We are able to automatically discover motions and contact schedules given only a terminal goal specified by the user. The generated motion plans are then tracked by a whole-body MPC.\nGiven only a commanded position (red sphere) and orientation (green arrow) the whole-body motion plan is optimized including gait, foothold positions and base pose references.\nResults on hardware Our novel contact-implicit trajectory optimization formulation in the motion refinement stage gives us a direct handle on the contact modes and is a crucial tool in overcoming the sim2real gap. In addition, through the use of a continuation method the generated motion plan has strict physical feasibility.To prove both of these claims, we tested the motion plans generated by our framework on hardware for a complex, under-actuated legged system.\nReport Previous Next     / [pdf] View the PDF file here.
